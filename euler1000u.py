# Euler problem inspired
#
# a,b,c being a fermat triple with a<b<c and (*) a+b+c=k=1000
#
# we use the generating equations 
#
# a=n**2-m**2
# b=2mn
# c=n**2+m**2
#
# primitive only if n,m coprime and one of them even the other odd 
# 
# for any give k the equation a+b+c=k yields 
#
# 2n**2+2nm=2*n*(m+n)=k 
#
# this means that solving eulers problem can be reduced to solving
# the diophanian equation k=2*n*(n+m) with the additional condition 
# n>m as we want a>0. Renaming u=k/2 we solve u=n(m+n)
#
# (0) k has to be even
# (1) we use that the maximum n has to be smaller then sqrt(u)
# (2) m<n 
# (3) n must divide u to solve the equation
# (4) n+m must divide u
